iOS-htmltopdf
=============

This class enables simple URL-based PDF creation. Pages are created the exact same way they would be if the user printed the content on an iOS device (very similar as well as OS X print output).

Example code:

`` 
self.PDFCreator = [NDHTMLtoPDF createPDFWithURL:

[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/12/business/china-consumer-economy/index.html?hpt=hp_c1"]

                                         pathForPDF:[@"~/Documents/demo.pdf" stringByExpandingTildeInPath]
                                         
                                           delegate:self
                                           
                                           pageSize:kPaperSizeA4
                                           
                                            margins:UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 5, 10, 5)];
``

You can also use the alternative following code to generate PDF directly from HTML string, without using an URL. This is useful if you want your PDF generator to work offline or if you don't want to write first your code into a local file (you can then use NSURL with a local file through fileURLWithPath:) :

``
+ (id)createPDFWithHTML:(NSString*)HTML 

pathForPDF:(NSString*)PDFpath delegate:(id <NDHTMLtoPDFDelegate>)delegate

               pageSize:(CGSize)pageSize
               
               margins:(UIEdgeInsets)pageMargins
``

A paper size is only defined by a rect (e.g. kPaperSizeA4 CGSizeMake(595,842)).

Please, be sure to create a property (e.g. `PDFCreator`) as NDHTMLtoPDF works asynchronously using UIWebView.
